# SimMIM3D for Medical Image Data

### Overview

This repository contains the experimental work related to my bachelor thesis. In this project, I implemented the SimMIM (Simple Framework for Masked Image Modeling) in 3D, specifically for medical image data. The datasets used in these experiments are [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and [BraTS17](http://medicaldecathlon.com/) (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge).

This implementation follows the original 2D [SimMIM by Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/SimMIM) to handle 3D medical imaging data, offering potential advancements in medical image analysis. It uses [MONAI](https://monai.io/) and [Pytorch-Lightning](https://lightning.ai/pytorch-lightning).
